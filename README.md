# Python_Graphics
Short Graphics Projects for classes
Finished simple projects for a graphics class. Due to the implementation of the drawing program, multithreading was the simple way to allow the console and drawing to complete.
Further improvements would be to allow both portions of the program to close on exit from either one, or close the graphics immediately on console exit, but remove access the graphic manipulation after exiting the drawing window.
All projects were interesting, it was a well taught class.
