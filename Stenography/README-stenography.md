Performs stenography on provided .bmp file with provided input.
The program takes a .bmp image and slightly modifies the red pixels to create an image. A new picture is created and saved with the message stored in the pixels. 
  An end of file marker is attached to the end of the message. 
The program can also be used to decrypt the message within the pixels, and will try to decrypt any potential message (whether real or not) from the image.
WARNING - .jpg compression does NOT keep image resolution. Please resave image as .bmp before using stenography program. The image will be modified slightly, but no useful message will be shown.
